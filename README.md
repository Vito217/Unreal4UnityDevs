# The Unreal Guide for Unity devs

A Unreal Engine guide for Unity developers. I'm slowly learning Unreal, so please, tell me if some information is wrong.

| Unity class/method | Unreal equivalent | Description |
--- | --- | ---
| MonoBehaviour.Start() | AActor::BeginPlay() | Called when Play happens |
| MonoBehaviour.Update() | AActor::Tick() | Called every frame on the MonoBehaviour/Actor object |
